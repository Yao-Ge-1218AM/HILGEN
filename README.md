# HILGEN: Hierarchically-Informed Data Generation for Biomedical NER Using Knowledgebases and LLMs

## Overview

HILGEN is a novel approach designed to improve the performance of few-shot learning (FSL) in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) by leveraging domain knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5. This project aims to address the challenges of limited annotated data in medical NLP tasks by generating synthetic training examples that enrich the representation of rare medical concepts.
